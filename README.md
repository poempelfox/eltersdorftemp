## Introduction

This is WIP.

## hardware

* ESP32 DevKitC V4 (from AZ delivery) for control and WiFi
* SHT41 temperature and humidity sensor. This could be replaced by a SHT45, preferably the version with integrated filter membrane, once proper breakout boards become available, without requiring any software changes.
* LPS35HW pressure sensor
* SEN50 particulate matter sensor
* (probably) RG15 rain sensor
* (perhaps) DS18B20 temperature sensor in moulded metal case to measure ground temperature 50 cm below ground
* the following sensors will definitely not be included:
** wind sensor - too many building in the surroundings, this would not measure anything useful
** light / UV sensor - too many things giving shadows at random times around
